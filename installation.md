You'll just need to install the `@colorfy-software/react-native-modalfy` package in your React Native project. 

```shell
yarn add @colorfy-software/react-native-modalfy
# or use npm
# npm install --save @colorfy-software/react-native-modalfy
```

And that's it, no further action needed. Now you can move onto actually using the library through the modal stack!
