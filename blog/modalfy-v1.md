# Introducing a Modal Citizen

Here we are! After long days and reaaally long nights of failures, successes (and eventually documentation) we're really proud to present **React Native Modalfy** to the world!

![It's celebration time!](https://media.giphy.com/media/ZUomWFktUWpFu/giphy.gif)

The rationale and everything that has to do with the genesis of the library is available in this article: ðŸ¥ž[Stacks on stack in React Native](https://medium.com/p/eb4f8fb9e4c9).

All you'll need to know will be available right here, in this documentation. If you want to contribute, give your feedback or just say hello: feel free to chime in the repo on GitHub!

**Until then: enjoy building modals and even more!**
