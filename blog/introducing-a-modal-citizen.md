# Introducing a Modal Citizen

Here we are! After long days \(and reaaally long nights\) we're really proud to present React Native Modalfy to the world!

![It&apos;s celebration time!](https://media.giphy.com/media/ZUomWFktUWpFu/giphy.gif)

The rationale and everything that has to do with the genesis of the library is available in this medium article: ðŸ¥ž[Stacks on stack in React Native](https://medium.com/p/eb4f8fb9e4c9).

Everything else is available right here, [in this documentation](../). And if you need anything else, feel free to chime in the repo on GitHub! __Until then: enjoy building modals and even more!
